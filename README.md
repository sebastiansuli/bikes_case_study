# Case study from Google Data Analytics Certificate

This is the Cyclistic bike-share analysis case study from the Google Data Analytics Certificate that I finished a few months ago and wrote in R.<br>
In this case study, I imagined that I worked for a fictional company called Cyclistic, which wants to maximize the number of annual memberships. To achieve this, I needed to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently.<br>
For this purpose, I wrote code in R, cleaned the data, analyzed it, created visualizations, and then shared my conclusions.
